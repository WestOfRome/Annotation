title: Yeast Genome Annotation and Manipulation Software
---

### Overview 

This is a documentation stub for the "Annotation" set of tools for managing and working with yeast genomes. The software is geared towards working with multiple closely related yeast species in a strong orthology framework. The software makes extensive use of synteny, the YGOB database and works best for more complete genomes.
